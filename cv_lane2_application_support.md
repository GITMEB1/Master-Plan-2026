## **Professional Profile**
**Implementation Specialist & SaaS Application Support** (10+ Years Experience).

I specialize in bridging the gap between chaotic technical requirements and stable, documented systems. My core strength is **Technical Problem Solving** (SQL, API logs) combined with **Modern Automation** (n8n, LLMs). I don't just solve tickets; I build assets that prevent them.

Returning to work following a planned career sabbatical where I upskilled in Applied AI Engineering, building production-ready automation stacks to manage complex logistical and data workflows.

*   **Implementation**: Data migration, UAT planning, requirements gathering.
