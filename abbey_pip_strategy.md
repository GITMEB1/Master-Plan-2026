# Project: Abbey's Personal Independence Payment (PIP) - "The Wall of Evidence"

**Objective**: Win a new PIP claim (Daily Living + Mobility) by overwhelming the assessor with undeniable, professional evidence.
**Previous Status**: Failed at Tribunal (Deadline passed).
**New Strategy**: Do not rely on "explaining" it well. Rely on **external validation**.

---

## Phase 1: The Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
*Goal: Gather the ammo before firing the shot.*

### 1.1 The "Bad Day" Diary (The Granular Truth)
Assessors exploit vague language ("sometimes", "often"). We need binary data.
*   **Action**: Create a 7-Day "Living Diary".
*   **Format**:
    *   *08:00*: Did she need help getting out of bed? (Yes/No - Detail: Pain Level 1-10).
    *   *09:00*: Could she prepare breakfast unaided? (Yes/No - Detail: Grip strength failure?).
    *   *12:00*: Did she need prompting to eat/medicate? (Yes/No - Detail: Executive dysfunction?).
*   **Advcocacy Note**: We are documenting the *impact*, not just the diagnosis.

### 1.2 The Professional Alliance
We need statements from people with letters after their names.
*   **Target list**:
    1.  **GP**: Request a summary of medical history specifically highlighting *functional impairment*.
    2.  **Specialist/Consultant**: Request a letter confirming the diagnosis and its *chronic/degenerative* nature.
    3.  **Mental Health Professional / Counselor**: Statement on the psychological impact of daily tasks.
    4.  **Social Worker / Support Worker** (if applicable).
*   **The "Ask"**: Do not just ask for a "letter". Draft a bullet-point list of her difficulties and ask them to *sign/verify* it. "Dr X, can you confirm that these symptoms are consistent with her condition?"

---

## Phase 2: The Application (Weeks 5-6)
*Goal: Submit a claim that looks like a legal bundle, not a form.*

### 2.1 The Form (PIP2)
*   **Rule**: Never write "She struggles with...". Write "She **cannot** do X reliably, repeatedly, ensuring safety, and within a reasonable time because..." (The 4 Legal Tests).
*   **Mapping**:
    *   **Preparing Food**: Cannot hold pans (Safety)? Needs supervision (Prompting)?
    *   **Washing/Bathing**: Needs physical assistance?
    *   **Mobility**: Can she walk 20m? 50m? *Reliably?* If she walks 20m but is in bed for 2 days after, she **cannot** do it.

### 2.2 The Bundle
*   Cover Letter: "Please find attached evidence list."
*   The Form.
*   The Diary (7 Days).
*   Professional Letters (x3).

---

## Phase 3: The Assessment (Week 8+)
*Goal: Control the narrative.*

*   **Request**: Ask for the assessment to be **Recorded**. (This changes their behavior).
*   **Presence**: You (Danny) attend as the "Appointee" or Advocate. You take notes.
*   **Prep**: We review the "Bad Day" diary the night before.
